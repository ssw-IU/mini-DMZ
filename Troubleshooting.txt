Troubleshooting :

1. CAS authentication page is not presented when the guacamole page is visited.

Check the CAS_AUTHORIZATION_ENDPOINT and make sure it is the appropriate url.
DO NOT use the CAS login url (Ex : https://cas.iu.edu/cas/login or https://www.purdue.edu/apps/account/cas/login)
Use instead https://cas.iu.edu/cas/ as CAS_AUTHORIZATION_ENDPOINT

2. CAS authentication is successful but presented with a blank page. No connection available.
Check whether the CAS username is present in authorized users list. The administrator can add other CAS usernames to allow them access to the equipment.
If the administrator is unable to see any connection, re-run the setup.py in guacamole with the parameter -u USERNAME which should match the CAS Username.


3.Issue similar to "The {link} specified in the {file} is invalid"

The error would clearly state which links are invalid. Find the link in the {file} and use a browser to check why the link doesn't work.

This usually happens when the link is dead and the package has been moved to a new location due to an upgrade. 
Easy way to handle this is considering the following example.

[Error] The link https://www-us.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.21/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.21.tar.gz specified in the Guacamole Dockerfile is invalid.

Go to the link https://www-us.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-8/ in a browser. You would notice that the folder v8.5.21 is missing. Instead, there might
be a folder v8.5.23 which is the updated version of tomcat package. 

So go to settings.py file, change the TOMCAT_VERSION from  8.5.21 to 8.5.23. Now re-run the script
